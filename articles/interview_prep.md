# Interview Prep

Having switched jobs a few times over the last few years, I've done a *a lot* of software engineering
interviews. In my most recent job search, for instance, I did around eight phone screens followed
by six onsites.

The most stressful part of any interview for me, and most likely for other job candidates,
is the "technical coding" questions that inevitably get asked; most companies require you to solve
at least one during a phone screen, and then another 2-3 once you get onsite.

Over the last few job searches, I've developed a strategy that has significantly improved my performance
on these questions, to the point that I'm now rarely phased by them. In this post, I'd like to share
what I've learned.

## Practice, Practice, Practice

The key to doing an excellent job in a coding-oriented software interview is very simple- you
*must* practice beforehand. The interesting thing about practice is that it's both more effective
and more necessary than you would intuitively think. Let's dig in more.

### Why it's more effective than you think

Software is such a broad field and there are so many technologies and applications that could come up in an
interview! Sure, practice can help, but how can it really make that much of a difference?

The reality, however, is that only a small subset of these are appropriate for an interview. In
particular, companies generally restrict their questions to those that:

1. Can be explained in under 5 minutes
2. Can be solved by a smart, prepared candidate in under 30 minutes
3. Don't require specialized, domain-specific knowledge
  (e.g., around networking, databases, cryptography, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), etc.)
4. Don't require external data, hardware, or user interaction
5. Touch on a subset of intro-undergraduate-level algorithms and data structures including
  sorting, searching, dynamic programming, lists, hashmaps, etc.

These restrictions significantly reduce the surface area of possible questions. Even if you
get a question that isn't exactly like one you covered in your practice, chances are that it
has some similarities and you can use those to your advantage.

### Why it's more necessary than you think

Another misconception is that if you're

Leetcode is a site designed for practicing interview-style coding questions. 



### How much time?

### Aside: Picking a language

Most companies don't care what language you use as long as it's something that they can follow.
