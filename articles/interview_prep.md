# Interview Prep

Having switched jobs a few times over the last few years, I've done a *a lot* of software
engineering interviews. In my most recent job search, for instance, I did around eight phone screens
followed by six onsites.

The most stressful part of any interview for me, and most likely for other job candidates,
is the "technical coding" questions that inevitably get asked; most companies require you to solve
at least one during a phone screen, and then another two to three once you get onsite.

Over the last few job searches, I've developed a strategy that has significantly improved my
performance on these questions, to the point that I'm now rarely phased by them. In this post, I'd
like to share what I've learned.

## Practice, Practice, Practice

The key to doing an excellent job in a coding-oriented software interview is very simple- you
*must* practice beforehand. The interesting thing about practice is that it's both more effective
and more necessary than one would intuitively think. Let me explain more.

### Why it's more effective than you think

Software is such a broad field and there are so many technologies and applications that could come
up in an interview! Sure, practice can help, but how can it really make that much of a difference?

The reality, however, is that only a small subset of these are appropriate for an interview. In
particular, companies generally restrict their questions to those that:

1. Can be explained in under 5 minutes
2. Can be solved by a good candidate, starting from scratch, in under 30 minutes
3. Don't require specialized, domain-specific knowledge
  (e.g., around networking, databases, cryptography, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), etc.)
4. Don't require external data, documentation, hardware, or software libraries / code
5. Touch on intro-undergraduate-level algorithms and data structures including
  sorting, searching, dynamic programming, lists, hashmaps, etc.

These restrictions significantly reduce the surface area of possible questions. Even if you
get a question that isn't exactly like one you covered in your practice, chances are that it
has some similarities to one you have seen, and you can use those to your advantage.

### Why it's more necessary than you think

Another misconception is that if you're already doing a lot of hands-on software development
as part of your day-to-day job, this replaces the need for practice. That would make sense
if companies only asked practical questions, but the reality is that most don't. In fact,
the vast, vast majority of questions I've gotten over the years have little direct overlap with the
work I've done in the past or, most likely, the work that I would do if hired by the interviewer's
company.

The reason for this gets back to the criteria listed above; day-to-day projects rarely,
if ever, satisfy all of these. Most questions are completely synthetic and, thus, you need practice
beyond your day-to-day work to really get a handle on them.

## Enter Leetcode

Leetcode is a site designed for practicing interview-style coding questions. It has a large pool
of questions and an online code editor that allows you to write up and submit solutions to these.
Each submission is run against a set of question-specific test cases that verify both the
correctness and efficiency of the solution. If you get stuck, you can get help by looking through
official solution writeups (available for the most popular questions) or reading the messages on
each question's discussion board.

There are a bunch of other sites in the general "code interview prep" space. I've been
less satisfied with the ones that I've looked at, however, because their questions feel less
realistic to me; they're either not the right level of difficulty, or they're simply too long to do
in a 45 minute interview. These questions may be fun to work through, but if your goal is to prep
for interviews, solving them may not be the most efficient use of time.

## Strategy

I generally start practicing in Leetcode about 3 weeks before my first interview. My general
strategy is:

1. **Pay for a one month premium subscription.** This allows you to sort the questions by frequency
  (see item 2) and also provides some other benefits like getting access to locked questions.
2. **Sort the questions in descending order of frequency.** There are over 1000 questions; sorting
  by frequency is extremely helpful for focusing on the most common types of questions.
3. **Start at the top, work down (roughly).** I generally don't do the questions in exact order;
  in particular, I may skip harder questions at the beginning and then come back to them. Later
  on in the process, as I feel more confident, I'll skip over easy questions or ones that are
  very similar to questions I've already done.

My goal is to complete around 100 questions by the time of my first interview. I then continue
practicing while interviews are ongoing until my one month subscription is over.

### Aside: Picking a language


## The Hit Parade

During my most recent rounds of interviewing, there were some types of questions that came up
over-and-over again. If you're on the market, 

### Searching and/or exploring in a 2D grid

See Leetcode 

### Evaluating arithmetic expressions

Some examples here include 

### Designing and implementing key/value stores or caches
