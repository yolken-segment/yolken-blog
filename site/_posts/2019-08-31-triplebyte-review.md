In my most recent job search, I used a service called
[Triplebyte](https://triplebyte.com/) to connect with potential employers.
Triplebyte basically plays the role of a third-party recruiter- it matches
you with jobs at client companies with whom it has signed explicit
solicitation agreements. If a candidate is brought in by the recruiter
and ends up signing an offer with a client, the client pays a certain
percentage of the the candidate's first year salary (typically 25%) as a fee.

Unlike traditional third-party recruiters, who really just connect you
with their clients' own recruiters, Triplebyte actually does some of the
technical screening itself. It also uses technology (i.e., a slick web site)
to handle a lot of the logistics around sending messages back and forth,
scheduling calls, collecting feedback, etc.

In the end, I decided to accept an offer for a job that I found through
another source. However, I had an interesting experience with Triplebyte, and
I wanted to share my thoughts in case others are considering using their
services.

## How Triplebyte works

First, you do a short, online, multiple-choice test that covers coding, SQL,
computer hardware, and a few other, related topics.

If you pass the online test, then you can schedule a two hour video chat with a
Triplebyte interviewer. This chat is like a traditional, technical phone screen,
except longer- it covers writing code, debugging an existing codebase, systems
design, and basic technical knowledge (e.g., how HTTP works).

If you pass the video interview, then you move to the matching phase. The
Triplebyte site shows you a list of companies matching your criteria; you can
select which you're particularly interested in and (optionally) write them
messages explaining why. You also fill out a calendar to specify when you're
available for "pitch" calls.

After a few days, your profile goes "live" allowing companies to see it. If
you've already expressed interest in a company, and they're also interested
in you, they're allowed to put a call in your calendar without asking. If they're
interested in you but you didn't explicitly express interest in them, they can
still write you a message asking for a chance to chat; if you accept,
then they're also allowed to put time in your calendar.

You then do a 30-45 minute call with each company that you've matched with.
These calls are mostly for the companies to sell themselves to you. They can
also ask you questions about your background and interests, although, per
Triplebyte policy, they're not allowed to ask any technical questions at this
stage.

After each call, both you and the company indicate whether you want to move
forward. If there's still a match, you work with the company to schedule
an on-site, and from this point forward you follow the standard, non-Triplebyte
process.

In the end, if you accept an offer from one of the companies you matched
with, the company pays Triplebyte according to their agreement. Triplebyte
doesn't disclose their fees publicly, but third-party recruiters typically
charge at least 25% of the candidate's first year salary.

## The stats

After making it through the multiple-choice screen and video interview, I was shown
around 50 companies that met my criteria (in San Francisco, 100+ employees).
Around 20 expressed interest in me, and I did pitch calls with 8 of them. 7 of
these invited me on-site, I did 2 on-sites, and, in the end, got 2 offers.

## The good

### Saving time

The marketing pitch for Triplebyte is that they save candidates time, and, at least
in my personal case, I found this to be true. It took a few hours for me
to set up my profile and do the initial screens, but it saved me much more
than that because I didn't have to do recruiter and technical screens for
each of the companies I matched with.

In addition to taking a lot of time, these per-company screens can be a pain to
schedule and usually have to be done during business hours. Triplebyte's interview,
on the other hand, is scheduled by picking a slot from a list of options
on their site. Because many of their interviewers are remote and/or working part-time,
they have slots available almost 24/7. I did my interview 9:00-11:00PM on a Friday night
with a nice Polish guy, for whom it was Saturday morning.

### Detailed feedback

Triplebyte provided very detailed feedback for the two hour video
interview that they did with me. I didn't learn too much from it that
I didn't already know, but I can imagine that this feedback would be helpful
for people who don't have a lot of recent interview experience.

### Low pressure

I've worked with several third-party recruiters in past job searches. They can be
extremely aggressive and needy, some to the point of wanting to chat nearly every day
until I've finally signed an offer.

Triplebyte's staff, on the other hand, were super laid back. I spoke to my "talent
manager" (i.e., recruiter) once on the phone and then maybe twice over
email over the following weeks.

## The bad

### Trivia questions in interviews

Some of the questions

### Matching limitations

The 5 or so client companies that I was most interested in chose not to match
with me. This was their right, of course, but it was a little frustrating, and
it's an aspect of the process that Triplebyte's marketing glosses over.

In the end, I still matched with some interesting companies, so I still felt
that Triplebyte was worth it. However, I've heard anecdotally that some candidates
have trouble matching with any companies that they're even remotely interested in;
this may be more likely if your profile is a little riskier for companies, i.e.
you're not already located in the Bay Area, you don't have well-known companies in
your resume, etc.

## The verdict

Overall, I would recommend Triplebyte to people seeking software engineering jobs
in the Bay Area. It doesn't require a huge amount of time and effort, and the downsides
are pretty limited; even if you don't pass their process, no one other than them
will know, and you can still apply to any of their client companies without prejudice.
