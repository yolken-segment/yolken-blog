I began my career as a
[product manager (PM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_manager#Product_management_in_software_development),
but then switched to being a software engineer (SWE) after three and a half years. While many people
start in engineering and then later go into product management, the direction that I travelled in is
pretty rare and something that people often ask me about when looking at my background.

In this post, I want to describe how I started as a PM, why I made the decision to switch, and
how it worked out.

## At the start

I come from a fairly non-traditional academic background- I did Electrical Engineering
(with some CS) in undergrad, and then spent four and a half years getting a PhD in
[Operations Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research). The details of
why I chose to get a PhD and why I chose this field in particular are too long to cover here,
so I'll leave them for a future post.

Towards the end of my PhD program, I got a summer internship at Google through a friend
from school who now worked there. Although the internship was technically in software engineering,
the project and day-to-day work were more research oriented- I was trying to figure out ways to more
efficiently allocate compute resources at Google, which was closely related to some of my PhD work.

I enjoyed the summer a lot, and towards the end of my internship I had the opportunity to apply for
full-time positions at Google. In addition to going through the SWE conversion process, my mentor
suggested that I also consider product management. The reason he gave is that PMs have higher-level
control of projects and also have a lot more flexibility in their day-to-day work. As an entry-level
SWE, I'd be expected to work on implementing small pieces in Google's resource allocation systems.
As a PM, on the other hand, I'd be able to architect the policies that those systems
implement (which is a much higher-leverage activity), and, moreover, be able to write code,
publish papers, and do other fun activities on the side.

His advice made a lot of sense to me, and, after many rounds of interviews, I got and signed
a full-time PM offer. Six months later, and one week after defending my dissertation, I joined
the product team at Google.

## Being a PM

I started as a PM on the team that I had interned with (Cluster Management), continuing my
summer project on resource allocation and resource efficiency. The summer work had involved
implementing a proof-of-concept and showing that it would have the desired impact from a
theoretical perspective. Now, six months later, the task was to actually implement this
new resource allocation framework and roll it out across the company.



## Switching

Once I decided to switch, I had two choices- I could either make the transition at Google or
just apply to engineering jobs at other companies. I had been at Google for a while and was
itching to leave and do something new, so I went with the latter.

Getting interviews was actually much easier than I had expected- despite having no formal
engineering experience on my resume, most companies I applied to were willing to give me a chance
because I was coming from a well-known place and had a bachelor's degree in a relevant field. The
interviews were tough, but I managed to get some solid offers and ultimately decided to sign on
as a SWE at [MoPub](https://mopub.com). I left Google, took a two week vacation, started
the new job, and have been an engineer ever since.

## Looking back

Switching to engineering was a great decision for me, and one that I've had zero regrets about.
I'm much, much happier as an engineer, and I think my career has turned out better because
of it. Although I spent a few years in a less-than-ideal role, I learned a lot from that experience,
and I think it's made me a better engineer because I'm able to incorporate product-related
thinking into my day-to-day work.

## How to decide?

Ultimately, which path to take really depends on what makes you happiest. I'm very introverted
and love sitting in front of my computer all day with my headphones in, so SWE is the best fit for
me. If you're more extroverted and would prefer to spend your time in meetings talking about product
direction, then PM might be a better path.

If you're thinking of switching between product and engineering, the lowest-risk approach is to try
out the other role for a few months at your current company. Large companies like Google
often have formal rotation programs for doing this; even at companies without these kinds of
programs, it's usually possible to negotiate a one-off rotation. If you're not able to do this,
you can at least try out some tasks on your team that are typically done by the "other" side-
as a PM, for instance, spend a few days fixing bugs in your team's code, or, as an engineer, talk to
some of your customers and write a requirements doc for a new product feature.
