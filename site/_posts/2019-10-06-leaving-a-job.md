Over the course of my career, I've had many jobs which of course means that I've also left
many jobs.

## Why consider leaving?

### The company

The strongest reason for leaving a job is that you've simply lost faith in the company. It could
be that the company isn't doing well financially, has weak leadership, is engaged in behavior
that you consider horribly unethical, or has had some kind of downward cultural shift since you
joined.

Company-level problems are really hard to get around because, unless you're the CEO, they're
outside of your direct control

### The team

Another reason for leaving is that there's something wrong with your team. It might be an
ineffective manager, coworkers that you don't get along with, boring projects, or bad work/life
balance.

These can be just as demoralizing as company-level issues (and sometimes even worse), but they're
typically addressable by switching teams. In some cases,

### The role

You may like your company and team, but be really unhappy

## Alternatives to leaving

### Switch teams

The easiest alternative to leaving is to just switch teams. Most tech companies allow
engineers to do this, with minimal red tape, provided that:

1. Your performance is satisfactory
2. You've been with your current team for "long enough"; the precise definition of "long enough"
    varies from company to company, but it's typically 9-12 months.
3. You can find another team that has available headcount and is willing to take you

The great thing about switching teams is that it's much easier and lower-risk than switching
companies, but, at the same time, could give your career just as much of a "jolt" as quitting
and starting someplace new would. When I transferred from Cluster Management to
Public Data at Google, for instance, the new team had completely different customers, leadership,
operating procedures, and technology. It took months to get fully up-to-speed (almost as much as a
role at a new company would), and kept me interested in staying at Google for several more years.

### Switch ladders

A more extreme version of switching teams is to stay at the same company but switch ladders, e.g.
move from engineering to product management. This is a bit higher-risk than switching teams, and
should only be done

### Negotiate improvements



## Giving notice

In the US most software engineers work "at will" which means, technically, that you're not
required to give any notice before quitting. Quitting suddenly, though, will probably piss off
your colleagues and burn bridges, so the standard courtesy is to give at least two week's notice.

I typically err on the side of giving even more notice, sometimes as far as six weeks in advance.
The main reason for this is that I'm usually interviewing for new jobs while finishing up
at my old one, and I don't want to have to lie to my manager about why I need to take
random vacation days in the middle of the week. Also, giving more notice gives the company
more time to address any grievances you have and (maybe) convince you to stay.

Some people say that it's risky to give more notice than necessary- technically, you could
be "walked out" early to prevent you from picking up information or skills that might be
useful to a competitor. In practice, though, I've *never* seen this happen at any of my employers.
Given the options, it's just easier and less disruptive to let people who want to quit do so
voluntarily and on their own schedule.
